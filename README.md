# Overview
This project involves the analysis of publicly available COVID-19 data. The aim was to understand the trends and impacts of COVID-19 by performing data cleaning and analysis. The project workflow includes:
- **Data Cleaning**: Processed raw data in Microsoft Excel to prepare it for analysis.
- **Database Import**: The cleaned data was imported into an SQL database for efficient querying.
- **Data Analysis**: Executed SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the data.

## Features
- Data cleaning using Excel (e.g., handling missing values, standardizing formats).
- Data import and schema design in SQL.
- Complex SQL queries to analyze trends, such as infection rates, mortality rates, and recovery patterns.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Microsoft Excel**: For data cleaning and preprocessing.
- **SQL**: For database management and query execution.

## Data Source
The COVID-19 dataset used in this project was obtained from [https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths].

## Queries
The SQL queries used for this analysis are included in the repository under CovidScript.sql.
Some of the key queries performed include:

- Identifying the countries with the highest infection rates.
- Analyzing monthly trends in COVID-19 cases.
- Calculating recovery and mortality rates over time.

## Future Work
- Incorporating more advanced visualizations using tools like Power BI or Tableau.
- Extending the analysis to include vaccination data.
- Automating the data pipeline for real-time analysis.
